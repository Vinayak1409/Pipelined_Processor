#Single_Cycle_processor

In this assignment, I have designed a single-cycle processor that follows MIPS ISA using Verilog on Xilinx ISE.
There are various components in this project:
1. ALU
2. Control Unit
3. Instruction Fetch
4. Register Memory
5. Instruction Decode
6. Instruction Memory
7. ALU Control Unit
8. Piplinned register.
9. Stalling and forwarding unit
10. check
11. check 2
